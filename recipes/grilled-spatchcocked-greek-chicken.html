    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This grilled spatchcocked chicken is simple to do and only requires a sharp pair of kitchen shears and 5 minutes of your time. Grilling over indirect heat keeps the chicken moist</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
        <li>1 (4.5 pound) whole chicken, spatchcocked</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, garlic, rosemary, and tarragon together in a measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1/2 of the oil mixture over the chicken and reserve the remaining 1/2. Using your hands, massage the oil mixture into the chicken skin. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken skin-side up over indirect heat for 50 minutes. Move chicken over direct heat and grill 5 minutes. Carefully flip chicken over skin-side down and grill until skin is brown and crispy, about 5 more minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle reserved oil mixture over the chicken. Carve and serve.</li>
    </ol>
